          <h5> Hi there! Welcome to my website. 
            I'm a computational scientist with an interest in using data science and machine learning techniques to better understand the impacts of climate change on the earth system and human society. 
            I have a bachelors degree in Atmospheric Science from UC Berkeley, and I'm currently a masters candidate in Hydrologic Science and Engineering at Colorado State University. 
            My graduate research focuses on how climate change impacts hydroclimatic extremes (e.g. flooding, droughts, and extreme precipitation) and how these events impact our society at large. 
            In my free time, I love to learn new things, explore new places, and spend time in nature. 
            At the moment, I'm enjoying studying Portuguese and participating in a salsa dance team.
