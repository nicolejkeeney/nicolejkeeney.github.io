			<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Calibrating a Wind Erosion Model</strong>
			- I've been collaborating with a team at UCLA and Cal State East Bay to calibrate a high resolution wind erosion model using remote sensing-derived vegetation data, meteorological data, <i>in-situ</i> horizontal sediment flux measurements. 
			This project is part of an initiative at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health to study the environmental dynamics of Valley Fever (<i>coccidioidomycosis</i>), 
			a fungal infection thought to be transmitted by airborne dust.

			<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Cloud-Optimized Polar Climate Model Validation</strong>
			- I contributed to code development for a cloud-optimized python toolkit for validating polar climate models using satellite data for key sea ice state variables. 
			This project focuses on streamlining the validation pipeline and developing easy-to-use methods for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.

			<i class="fa fa-globe"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://nicolekeeney.com/icesat2-book">ICESat-2 Jupyter Book</a></strong>
			- I built an interactive Jupyter Book that highlights python code for evaluating winter sea ice growth in the Arctic over several years.
			This project uses monthly gridded sea ice thickness data from NASA's ICESat-2 satellite mission, along with related sea ice and atmospheric datasets.

			<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/nicolejkeeney/fluxnet_ESI">Parameterizing a Drought Index</a></strong>
			- I conducted original research for an undergraduate honors thesis where I evaluated a parameterization of an evapotranspiration-based drought index. 
			This work relied on eddy covariance flux measurements from the <a href="https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet2015-dataset/">FLUXNET 2015</a> dataset and output from a planetary boundary layer model.
