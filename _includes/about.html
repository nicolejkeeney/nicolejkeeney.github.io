    	Hi there! Welcome to my website. 
    	I'm a scientist with an interest in using computational tools to study the impacts of climate change on the earth system and on human society. 
    	I view this as a deeply interdisciplinary field that is rooted in climate science &#127782; and computer science &#128105;, but that also touches the fields of public health, hydrology, ecology, and economics.
    	I earned a bachelors degree in Atmospheric Science from UC Berkeley &#128105;, and I started learning python for earth science applications during my undergraduate thesis.
    	My background in climate science and data science has allowed me to work on diverse and interesting problems, from Arctic sea ice dynamics &#129482; to dust modelling for public health applications. 
    	In my free time, I love to learn new things and explore new places. At the moment, I'm enjoying studying Spanish (a decade-long hobby of mine!) and learning to dance &#128131;.  
    	I've attached a few of my goals here, so people can get to know me outside of the professional sphere.
