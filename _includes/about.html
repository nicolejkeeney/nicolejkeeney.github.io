          <h5> Hi there! Welcome to my website. 
            I'm a scientist with an interest in using computational tools to study the impacts of climate change on the earth system and human society. 
            I completed a bachelors degree in Atmospheric Science at UC Berkeley in 2020, and I'm currently a PhD student in Hydrologic Science & Engineering at Colorado State University. 
            My background in climate science and data science has allowed me to work on a diverse range of topics, from studying Arctic sea ice dynamics to modelling dust transport for public health applications. 
            In my free time, I love to learn new things, explore new places, and spend time in nature. At the moment, I'm enjoying studying Spanish and learning to dance.
          </h5>
