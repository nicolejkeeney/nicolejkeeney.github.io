			- Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of hydroclimatic extremes--such as drought, flooding, and extreme precipitation-- around the globe. 
			As part of my graduate research at Colorado State University, I am studying the underlying physical mechanisms that contribute to extreme precipitation in different regions around the globe. 
			This work involves training a series of machine learning models to learn the atmospheric circulation patterns associated with extreme precipitation events. 
			I'll eventually use these trained models to study extreme precipitation in the future using climate model projections.
			Stay tuned-- I hope to present my preliminary results at the American Geophysical Union's 2024 Fall Meeting!

			- I work as a python developer and climate data scientist for the Cal-Adapt Analytics Engine, a cloud-based climate data analytics platform for Californiaâ€™s energy sector. 
			This is a huge project with partnerships in the public, private, and research sector to support climate adaptation in the state of California. 
			I'm part of the development/science team at <a href="https://eaglerockanalytics.com/">Eagle Rock Analytics.</a>.

			- As a research assistant at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, I collaborated with a team at UCLA and Cal State East Bay to calibrate a high resolution wind erosion model using remote sensing-derived vegetation data. 
			This project was part of an initiative at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health to study the environmental dynamics of Valley Fever (<i>coccidioidomycosis</i>), 
			a fungal infection transmitted by dust.

			- I developed code for a cloud-optimized python toolkit for validating polar climate models using satellite data. 
			This project focused on streamlining the validation pipeline and developing easy-to-use methods for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.

			<i class="fa fa-globe"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.icesat-2-sea-ice-state.info/">ICESat-2 Jupyter Book</a></strong>
			- With my research advisor, I built an interactive Jupyter Book that highlights python code for analyzing winter sea ice growth in the Arctic over several years. 
			This project uses monthly gridded sea ice thickness data derived from NASA's ICESat-2 satellite mission, along with related sea ice and atmospheric datasets.

			<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/nicolejkeeney/fluxnet_ESI">Parameterizing a Drought Index</a></strong>
			- I conducted original research for an undergraduate honors thesis where I evaluated a parameterization of an evapotranspiration-based drought index. 
			This work relied on eddy covariance flux measurements and output from a planetary boundary layer model.
